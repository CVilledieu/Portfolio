# My portfolio

Hopefully my portfolio speaks for itself. I have a passion for the more problem solving and technical side of development.

My portfolio has undergone a large amount of revisions. I originally created the front end using HTMX, but did not like the result. The page felt more static that I wanted. After switching to JS I went with the classic react path, but found it just wasn't the right fit. After creating everything with vanila JS, I still felt I could do better. 

### Tech stack used:
* Backend: Go
    * [Echo framework](https://echo.labstack.com/) for the server
    * [Air](https://github.com/air-verse/air) is not in the Github, but was used for reloading during development
* Database: SQLite
* Frontend: JS, HTML, CSS 
    * RSBuild
